# Kaggle-NLP-Challenge

## Task overview
This edition of the DÃ©fi IA pertains to NLP. The task is straightforward: assign the correct job category to a job description. This is thus a multi-class classification task with 28 classes to choose from.

The data has been retrieved from CommonCrawl. The latter has been famously used to train OpenAI's GPT-3 model. The data is therefore representative of what can be found on the English speaking part of the Internet, and thus contains a certain amount of bias. One of the goals of this competition is to design a solution that is both accurate as well as fair, as explained in the Evaluation section.

## Evaluation
The original aspect of this competition is that there will be 3 tracks on which solutions will be ranked. First of all, solutions are ranked according to the Macro F1 metric, which will be used to build the Kaggle leaderboard. The Macro F1 score is simply the arithmetic average of the F1 score for each class.

Like any Kaggle competition, there will be a public leaderboard as well as a private leaderboard. The public leaderboard will reflect your score on a 50% random subset of the test set. The scores for the private leaderboard will be derived from the other 50% subset. The goal is to produce the highest score on the private leaderboard.

The top 10 teams on the first track will be eligible to two other prizes:

We will rank solutions according to their fairness with respect to the provided genders. In other words, we want you to design a competitive solution that is not biased towards one gender in particular. To be specific, we will measure the average demographic parity across all classes.
We will also rank solutions according to their tidyness. This will be reflected by a subjective score based on the following criteria: reproducibility, readability, creativity.
